							But for some reason, you and I react the exact same

							The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
							by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
							evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
							and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
							of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper

							down upon thee with great vengeance and furious
							anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy
							My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord
							when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
